# tictactoe
An enhanced version of Tic Tac Toe using C++

## To Play:

## BEGIN GAME AND BOARD SET UP
Follow the commands as prompted. Enter "game" to begin a new game and choose Player 1 and Player 2 types (human or computer). 
Enter an interger > 0 and <= 26 for the width and height of the game board. 

## PLAYING 
To make a move, enter the command "place" followed by the desired row and column you would like to place your symbol (with no spaces). For example "place 1a" will place the player's symbol on the square at row 1 and column a.
When playing against a computer, the computer will automatically make its move when required. 

## UNDO
Human players are allowed 1 undo move each turn which can be performed by entering "undo" BUT players are not allowed to undo a move that results in a win or draw. When playing against a computer, "undo" will undo the human player's last move as well as the computer move that follows it. 

## QUIT
During a game, the command "quit" can be entered to quit the game (neither player will get any points in this case)

## GAME OVER
Once a game ends, the user has the option to enter "game" again to begin a new game (the points for each player will carry over)
Upon EOF, the final scores for each player and winner will be displayed
